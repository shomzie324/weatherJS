This application is a responsive weather app that uses the Accu Weather API to get current weather data based on the city and country. Default is "Toronto, Canada" and any location changes are saved to local storage.

Tech Used: html, css, js (es6 syntax), Bootswatch, fetch API, Accu Weather API

Note: Free API key is being used that has a limited number of daily API calls. If a 503 error is received that is probably why.
